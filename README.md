## Project Overview

This project focuses on mammographic tumor detection and segmentation using medical image processing techniques. The CBIS-DDSM dataset, which contains a variety of film mammography studies, is leveraged for this purpose. The main goal of the project is to develop a model that detects and segments tumor regions in mammographic films, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning for patients. Additionally, a web service is created that accepts a DICOM file, performs tumor detection and segmentation, and returns the results, providing a valuable tool for medical professionals.
